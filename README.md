# Coffee Guy

CoffeeGuy is a little PWA built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and following the [Google Developers Guide for PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

Most of the app was based on the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) tutorial about PWAs, with little additions to the mix and some personalization.

Hope you like it and start adding some coffees! üöÄ
